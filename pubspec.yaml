# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
# following page: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
  # The 'pluginClass' specifies the class (in Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, etc.)
  # which should be registered in the plugin registry. This is required for
  # using method channels.
  # The Android 'package' specifies package in which the registered class is.
  # This is required for using method channels on Android.
  # The 'ffiPlugin' specifies that native code should be built and bundled.
  # This is required for using `dart:ffi`.
  # All these are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
  # adding or updating assets for this project.
  plugin:
    platforms:
      # This plugin project was generated without specifying any
      # platforms with the `--platform` argument. If you see the `some_platform` map below, remove it and
      # then add platforms following the instruction here:
      # https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#plugin-platforms
      # -------------------
      some_platform:
        pluginClass: somePluginClass
    # -------------------

  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - assets/images/IMG_5637.JPG
    - assets/images/fileType/
    - assets/Icons/
    - assets/images/Icon name.png
    - assets/images/user_placeholder.png
    - assets/images/noPostYet.png
    - assets/images/privateIcon.png
    - assets/images/noVideo.png
    - assets/config/config.json
    - assets/



  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Material-Design-Iconic-Font
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Material-Design-Iconic-Font.ttf

  #
  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
